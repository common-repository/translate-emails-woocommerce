Add Multilingual support for ShopMagic WooCommerce automated emails. Use this WooCommerce email translation plugin and send follow up emails to your customers in many languages!

== Description ==

ShopMagic Multilingual Support is a free WooCommerce plugin. It is an add-on to [ShopMagic - a free email marketing automation plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shopmagic-for-woocommerce/).

**The latest version of ShopMagic (above 3.0) has built-in multilingual support, so you do not need this add-on anymore!**

This plugin lets you create two or more sets of independent automation for email campaigns, mailing, and follow up emails in WooCommerce, one for each language. If you use a multilingual plugin on your website, ShopMagic will detect it, and trigger automation for a specified language only. 

That way, you’re able to reach all of your international customers with powerful and fully customizable WooCommerce email marketing automation in your customers' languages.
